# Heatmap-and-attention-span
when a a video file(store, malls, etc..) is put into a specified target folder, then for that video footage heatmap will be generated and heatcount(how many people went through that spot) at a particular spot and how total time spent by the people at a particular spot.    Used Effdet-7 for person object detection and Graph network technique for Multi object tracking.
